# LangChain Learning

My personal learning repository for exploring LangChain and building AI agents. Here I'm experimenting with different approaches, tools, and patterns.

## What's Here

### LangChain Essentials Python

**Location:** `Langchain-essentials-python/`

Working through the fundamentals - building agents, using tools, handling memory, streaming, and more. Contains 9 notebooks covering:

- Agent creation
- Messages and communication
- Streaming
- Tool integration
- MCP adapters
- Memory
- Structured outputs
- Dynamic prompts
- Human-in-the-loop

**Setup:**

```bash
cd Langchain-essentials-python
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
```

See [Langchain-essentials-python/README.md](Langchain-essentials-python/README.md) for more details.

### AI Agents with LangGraph

**Location:** `ai-agents-langraph/`

Exploring multi-agent systems and LangGraph for building more complex agent workflows. Contains 6 lesson notebooks.

## Getting Started

1. Check out what's in each directory
2. Open the notebooks that look interesting
3. Experiment and modify things as you learn
